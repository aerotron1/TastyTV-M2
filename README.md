## Planning Stage ?

- With reference to client brief, a wireframe and user story was created.

- Sitmap starts with the Homepage (static) which will connect:-
  - Announcement
  - Programme
  - Random movie page

    As well as including the client initial requirements. The wireframe includes some extras such as the burger menu, sign in button, search feature etc.
